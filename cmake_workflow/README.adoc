== CMake Workflow [[cmake_workflow]]

This action runs a complete CMake workflow from source files.

- It validates the cmake version installed in the system, 
- updates cmake if the library has a different minimum version, 
- identifies what features that cmake version supports, and 
- runs a complete cmake workflow

The workflow includes the configure, build, test, and install steps. 

The action will adjusting the parameters as needed according to the features that cmake version supports. 
For instance, 

- if cmake version does not support the `-S ... -B ...` syntax, the action will create the build directory and
run the configuration step from there
- if the specified or default generator is multi-config, `CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES` will be used instead of 
`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`
- if cmake version does not support the `cmake --install` syntax, the `cmake --build --target install`
will be use instead.
- if cmake version does not support multiple targets in the `cmake --build` syntax, the action will run the build
step once for each target

The action also creates github annotations when warnings or errors are emitted at any of these steps. This includes
annotations for CMake errors and build error emitted from the compiler.

|Parameter |Description |Default
|`source-dir` |Directory for the source files. |`.`
|`build-dir` |Directory for the binaries relative to the source directory. |`build`
|`cmake-min-version` |The minimum cmake version for this workflow. If the existing version is below that, the action attempts to update CMake. |`3.5`
|`cmake_exec` |The cmake executable. |`cmake`
|`cc` |Path to C compiler. |(empty)
|`cxx` |Path to C++ compiler. |(empty)
|`cxxstd` |List of standards with which cmake will build and test the program. |(empty)
|`toolchain` |Path to toolchain. |(empty)
|`generator` |Generator name. |(empty)
|`build-type` |Build type. |`Release`
|`build-target` |Targets to build instead of the default target. |(empty)
|`install-prefix` |Path where the library should be installed. |`.local/usr`
|`run-tests` |Whether we should run tests. |`true`
|`install` |Whether we should install the library. 

The library is only installed once in the `install-prefix`.

The latest std version described in `cxxstd` is used for the installed version.
. |`true`
|`extra-args` |Extra arguments to cmake configure command. |(empty)
|`create-annotations` |Create github annotations on errors. |`true`
|`ref-source-dir` |A reference source directory for annotations. Any annotation filename will be relative to this directory. |`.`
|`trace-commands` |Trace commands executed by the workflow. |`false`
