challenging task, as there are various factors to consider such as the different compilers, operating systems, and architectures that the library may need to support. Furthermore, C++ itself is a complex language with a wide range of features, making it difficult to write comprehensive tests that cover all possible scenarios. To address these challenges, this repository provides a collection of GitHub actions that are specifically designed to test C++ libraries in a variety of environments. These actions aim to create a common and resilient set of tools that can be used to test libraries across a wide range of platforms and configurations. By leveraging the power of GitHub Actions, these C++ testing tools can be easily integrated into a development workflow, allowing developers to quickly and efficiently test their libraries with minimal effort. This can help to ensure that the library is functioning correctly and that it is compatible with a wide range of platforms and configurations. Whether you are a seasoned C++ developer or just starting out, these testing tools can help you to streamline your development workflow and ensure that your library is robust and reliable. With a comprehensive set of testing tools at your disposal, you can focus on writing high-quality code and delivering great software to your users.","title":"C++ Actions","component":"cpp-actions","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/cpp-actions/index.html","titles":[]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"Boost Software License - Version 1.0 - August 17th, 2003 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organization obtaining a copy of the software and accompanying documentation covered by this license (the \"Software\") to use, reproduce, display, distribute, execute, and transmit the Software, and to prepare derivative works of the Software, and to permit third-parties to whom the Software is furnished to do so, all subject to the following: The copyright notices in the Software and this entire statement, including the above license grant, this restriction and the following disclaimer, must be included in all copies of the Software, in whole or in part, and all derivative works of the Software, unless such copies or derivative works are solely in the form of machine-executable object code generated by a source language processor.

Besides the explicitly specified list of modules, the action can also scan directories for boost dependencies to implicitly determine what modules should be cloned.

For instance, If the CMake version does not support the -S …​ -B …​ syntax, the action will create the build directory and run the configuration step from there. If the specified or default generator is multi-config, CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES will be used instead of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, since the later is ignored by these generators. If the CMake version does not support the cmake --install syntax, the cmake --build --target install will be use instead. If the CMake version does not support multiple targets in the cmake --build syntax, the action will run the build step once for each target. The action also creates GitHub annotations when warnings or errors are emitted at any of these steps. This includes annotations for CMake errors at the configure step and build errors emitted from the compiler at the build step. steps: - name: CMake Workflow uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/cmake-workflow@master with: cmake-version: '>=3.20' source-dir: tests generator: ${{ matrix.generator }} toolchain: ${{ steps.package-install.outputs.vcpkg-toolchain }} build-type: ${{ matrix.build-type }} run-tests: true install-prefix: $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/.local cxxstd: ${{ matrix.cxxstd }} cc: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cc || matrix.cc }} ccflags: ${{ matrix.ccflags }} cxx: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cxx || matrix.cxx }} cxxflags: ${{ matrix.cxxflags }} shared: ${{ matrix.shared }} extra-args: ${{ ( !matrix.no-deps && format('-D BOOST_SRC_DIR=\"{0}\"', steps.boost-clone.outputs.boost-dir) ) || '' }} ${{ ( matrix.no-deps && '-D CPP_ACTIONS_NO_DEPS=ON' ) || '' }} export-compile-commands: ${{ matrix.time-trace }} package: true package-artifact: ${{ matrix.is-main }} ref-source-dir: .

A library that works flawlessly with one compiler might encounter issues when compiled with a different version or on a different platform. This is where the C Library Test Matrix GitHub Action comes to the rescue. The C Library Test Matrix GitHub Action is designed to automate the generation of a comprehensive test matrix for your C libraries given their requirements. It simplifies the process of testing your libraries across multiple compiler versions and platforms, reducing the manual effort and potential for human error. With this action, you can define a set of compiler versions, target platforms, standard requirements, and factors that you want to test your C++ library against. The action then automatically generates a test matrix by combining the specified compilers and platforms into a fractional factorial design, enabling you to run tests in a systematic and efficient manner. This action can ensure that your C++ library is thoroughly tested across a wide range of compiler versions and platforms. This approach significantly increases the chances of catching compatibility issues early on and helps in delivering a robust and reliable library that works across different environments. Automated test matrix generation: Define a list of compiler versions and platforms, and let the action handle the creation of the test matrix. Easy integration: Simply include the C++ Library Test Matrix GitHub Action in your workflow configuration to start generating the test matrix. Customization options: Fine-tune the test matrix generation process by specifying additional compiler flags, build configurations, or test suites. Comprehensive test coverage: Ensure your C++ library is thoroughly tested across multiple compiler versions and platforms to identify and address compatibility issues. Get started with the C Library Test Matrix GitHub Action today and streamline your C library testing process. Say goodbye to manual matrix creation and embrace automated, systematic testing to deliver high-quality C++ libraries that work seamlessly across different compilers and platforms. The action should be run as extra initial “setup” job in your workflow. The job will run the action and output matrix, which is a JSON string containing the whole matrix. This matrix should be output of your first setup job. In your second build job, you can attribute the entire matrix to the strategy.matrix.include parameter and create your workflow as usual with the parameters from the matrix: jobs: cpp-matrix: runs-on: ubuntu-latest name: Generate Test Matrix outputs: matrix: ${{ steps.cpp-matrix.outputs.matrix }} steps: - name: Generate Test Matrix uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/cpp-matrix@master id: cpp-matrix with: standards: '>=11' build: needs: cpp-matrix strategy: fail-fast: false matrix: include: fromJSON(needs.cpp-matrix.outputs.matrix) # use matrix entries name: ${{ matrix.name }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.runs-on }} container: ${{ matrix.container }} steps: - name: Clone library uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Setup C++ Compiler uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/setup-cpp@master id: setup-cpp with: compiler: ${{ matrix.compiler }} version: ${{ matrix.version }} - name: CMake Workflow uses: ./cmake-workflow with: cc: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cc || matrix.cc }} cxx: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cxx || matrix.cxx }} cxxstd: ${{ matrix.cxxstd }} cxxflags: ${{ matrix.cxxstd }} # And you've safely tested your C++ library just like that... steps: - name: Generate Test Matrix uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/cpp-matrix@master id: cpp-matrix with: standards: '>=11' factors: 'gcc Asan Shared No-Deps msvc Shared x86 clang Time-Trace mingw Shared ' Parameter Description Default compilers A list of compilers to be tested. Each compiler can be complemented with its semver version requirements to be tested. When the compiler version requirements are provided, the action will break the requirements into subsets of major versions to be tested. When no version is provided, the '*' semver requirement is assumed. The action can identifies subsets of compiler versions for GCC, Clang, and MSVC. For any other compilers, the version requirements will passthrough to the output. . gcc >=4.8 clang >=3.8 msvc >=14.2 apple-clang * mingw * clang-cl * standards A semver range describing what C standards should be tested. The compiler ranges are adjusted to only include compilers that support any subrange of these requirements. These requirements can include C standards as 2 or 4 digits versions, such as 11, 2011, 98, or 1998. 2 digit versions are normalized into the 4 digits form so that 11 > 98 (2011 > 1998). . >=11 max-standards The maximum number of standards to be tested with each compiler. For instance, if 'max-standards' is 2 and the compiler supports '11,14,17,20,23' given the in the standard requirements, the standards 20,23 will be tested by this compiler. . 2 latest-factors The factors to be tested with the latest versions of each compiler. For each factor in this list, the entry with the latest version of a compiler will be duplicated with an entry that sets this factor to true. Other entries will also include this factor as false. The following factors are considered special: 'asan', 'ubsan', 'msan', 'tsan', and 'coverage'. When these factors are defined in an entry, its 'ccflags', 'cxxflags', and 'linkflags' value are also modified to include the suggested flags for factor. . gcc Coverage TSan UBSan factors The factors to be tested with other versions of each compiler. Each factor in this list will be injected into a version of the compiler that is not the latest version. An entry with the latest version of the compiler will be duplicated with this factor if there are no entries left to inject the factor. Other entries will also include this factor as false. . gcc Asan Shared msvc Shared x86 clang Time-Trace mingw Shared generate-summary Generate summary with the complete matrix. true trace-commands Trace commands executed by the action. false Output Description matrix The test matrix is an array of dictionaries, where each entry represents a combination of compiler version and factors to be tested. Each entry in the test matrix dictionary contains the following key-value pairs: - name: A suggested name for the job testing this entry - runs-on: A suggested github runner image name for the job testing this entry - container: A suggested docker container for the job testing this entry - compiler: Specifies the name of the compiler to be used for the test configuration. This can be used as input to the setup-cpp action. - version: Specifies the version requirements of the compiler to be used for the test configuration. This can be used as input to the setup-cpp action. - is-latest: Specifies whether the entry version requirement is the latest version among the test configurations. - is-main: Specifies whether the entry version requirement is the latest version among the test configurations without any factors applied. - is-earliest: Specifies whether the entry version requirement is the earliest version among the test configurations. - cxx: The usual name of the C compiler executable. If using the `setup-cpp` action, its output should be used instead. - `cc`: The usual name of the C compiler executable. If using the `setup-cpp` action, its output should be used instead. - `cxxstd`: A list of standards that should be tested with this compiler version. This option considers the `max-standards` latest standards supported by each compiler in its subrange of `standards`. - `b2-toolset`: The usual name of the toolset to be used in a b2 workflow. - `generator`: A CMake generator recommended to run the CMake workflow. - `build-type`: A build type recommended to test this entry. This is usually `Release`, unless some special factor that requires `Debug` is defined. - `ccflags`: The recommended C flags to be used by this entry. It reflects the values of special factors, such as sanitizers, coverage, and time-trace. - `cxxflags`: The recommended C flags to be used by this entry.
