challenging task, as there are various factors to consider such as the different compilers, operating systems, and architectures that the library may need to support. Furthermore, C++ itself is a complex language with a wide range of features, making it difficult to write comprehensive tests that cover all possible scenarios. To address these challenges, this repository provides a collection of GitHub actions that are specifically designed to test C++ libraries in a variety of environments. These actions aim to create a common and resilient set of tools that can be used to test libraries across a wide range of platforms and configurations. By leveraging the power of GitHub Actions, these C++ testing tools can be easily integrated into a development workflow, allowing developers to quickly and efficiently test their libraries with minimal effort. This can help to ensure that the library is functioning correctly and that it is compatible with a wide range of platforms and configurations. Whether you are a seasoned C++ developer or just starting out, these testing tools can help you to streamline your development workflow and ensure that your library is robust and reliable. With a comprehensive set of testing tools at your disposal, you can focus on writing high-quality code and delivering great software to your users.","title":"C++ Actions","component":"cpp-actions","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/cpp-actions/index.html","titles":[]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"Boost Software License - Version 1.0 - August 17th, 2003 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organization obtaining a copy of the software and accompanying documentation covered by this license (the \"Software\") to use, reproduce, display, distribute, execute, and transmit the Software, and to prepare derivative works of the Software, and to permit third-parties to whom the Software is furnished to do so, all subject to the following: The copyright notices in the Software and this entire statement, including the above license grant, this restriction and the following disclaimer, must be included in all copies of the Software, in whole or in part, and all derivative works of the Software, unless such copies or derivative works are solely in the form of machine-executable object code generated by a source language processor.

Only the specified modules are cloned and cached. This is usually the next step in your workflow after setting up a C++ compiler with Setup C++ or installing other dependencies with Install Packages. Cloning boost is useful when one wants the always use the latest version of boost in a library or is writing a boost proposal. For other use cases, individual boost modules can be fetched with vcpkg in Install Packages or directly included in a package manager manifest. Besides the explicitly specified list of modules, the action can also scan directories for boost dependencies to implicitly determine what modules should be cloned. The union of the implicitly and explicitly specified modules is cloned. Caching is based only on these dependencies. For a project with about 5 boost dependencies, caching saves about 4 minutes in the workflow. When there’s no cache, the scanning scripting saves us about 3 minutes. After cloning boost modules for your C++ project, the next step in your workflow should usually be CMake Workflow.

This is usually the next step in your workflow after setting up a C++ compiler and fetching dependencies with Install Packages. A workflow is composed of the following steps: Configure Build Test Install The action also sets up the environment for the workflow: It validates the CMake version installed in the system, Updates CMake if the library has a different minimum version, Identifies what features the current CMake version supports, and Runs a complete cmake workflow The action will adjusts the parameters as needed according to the features that CMake version supports. For instance, If the CMake version does not support the -S …​ -B …​ syntax, the action will create the build directory and run the configuration step from there. If the specified or default generator is multi-config, CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES will be used instead of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, since the later is ignored by these generators. If the CMake version does not support the cmake --install syntax, the cmake --build --target install will be use instead. If the CMake version does not support multiple targets in the cmake --build syntax, the action will run the build step once for each target. The action also creates GitHub annotations when warnings or errors are emitted at any of these steps. This includes annotations for CMake errors at the configure step and build errors emitted from the compiler at the build step. After running the a complete CMake workflow for your project, the next step in your workflow should usually be the generation of reports, with tools such as the Create Flamegraph (when matrix.time-trace) and Create Changelog (usually in another workflow job). You can also include customs steps to upload coverage reports (when matrix.coverage). If your project provides CMake installation and configuration scripts, it is also usual to include multiple CMake workflow steps as integration tests for CMake. steps: - name: CMake Workflow uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/cmake-workflow@master with: cmake-version: '>=3.20' source-dir: tests generator: ${{ matrix.generator }} toolchain: ${{ steps.package-install.outputs.vcpkg-toolchain }} build-type: ${{ matrix.build-type }} run-tests: true install-prefix: $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/.local cxxstd: ${{ matrix.cxxstd }} cc: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cc || matrix.cc }} ccflags: ${{ matrix.ccflags }} cxx: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cxx || matrix.cxx }} cxxflags: ${{ matrix.cxxflags }} shared: ${{ matrix.shared }} extra-args: ${{ ( !matrix.no-deps && format('-D BOOST_SRC_DIR=\"{0}\"', steps.boost-clone.outputs.boost-dir) ) || '' }} ${{ ( matrix.no-deps && '-D CPP_ACTIONS_NO_DEPS=ON' ) || '' }} export-compile-commands: ${{ matrix.time-trace }} package: true package-artifact: ${{ matrix.is-main }} ref-source-dir: .

A library that works flawlessly with one compiler will almost certainly fail to build with a different compiler version, not mention different compilers and platforms. This has a viral effect with enormous implications to the C++ ecosystem. If your library doesn’t properly test and support all platforms in its manifest, this support is also broken for any projects depending on your library. With some notable exceptions, this is currently the case with most small standalone libraries one can find on GitHub. These are libraries that could be very useful otherwise, so avoid dependencies altogether is not a reasonable to the problem, since we will never get anywhere meaningful if we’re not able to stand to the shoulder of giants. The C Matrix Action is designed to automate the generation of a comprehensive test matrix for your C libraries given their requirements. It simplifies the process of defining the contract of what platforms your library supports and testing your project across a proper selected subset of revelant compiler versions and platforms. With this action, you can define a set of requirements to test your C++ library. It will then generate a test matrix by combining the specified requirements into a fractional factorial design to ensure all proper combinations are tested in a systematic manner. This approach significantly increases the chances of catching compatibility issues early on and helps in delivering a robust and reliable library to users. The action should be run as extra initial “setup” job in your workflow. The job will run the action and output matrix, which is a JSON string containing the whole matrix. This matrix should be output of your first setup job. In your second build job, you can attribute the entire matrix to the strategy.matrix.include parameter and create your workflow as usual with the parameters from the matrix: jobs: cpp-matrix: runs-on: ubuntu-latest name: Generate Test Matrix outputs: matrix: ${{ steps.cpp-matrix.outputs.matrix }} steps: - name: Generate Test Matrix uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/cpp-matrix@master id: cpp-matrix with: standards: '>=11' build: needs: cpp-matrix strategy: fail-fast: false matrix: include: fromJSON(needs.cpp-matrix.outputs.matrix) # use matrix entries name: ${{ matrix.name }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.runs-on }} container: ${{ matrix.container }} steps: - name: Clone library uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Setup C++ Compiler uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/setup-cpp@master id: setup-cpp with: compiler: ${{ matrix.compiler }} version: ${{ matrix.version }} - name: CMake Workflow uses: ./cmake-workflow with: cc: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cc || matrix.cc }} cxx: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cxx || matrix.cxx }} cxxstd: ${{ matrix.cxxstd }} cxxflags: ${{ matrix.cxxstd }} # And you've safely tested your C++ library just like that... In some cases, it might be useful to test different matrices based on the conditions of the workflow. These conditions might be the event_type and the types of files changed in the commit triggering the workflow. The workflows might vary between disabling tests for changes that don’t affect these certain files, running a reduced subset of tests for less important changes, or enabling extra tests, such as documentation tests in case only these files have been changed. This might be useful in terms of performance, costs, and safety. While this is hard to achieve with hard-coded matrices, this action makes variable matrices very easy to achieve. Simply define a previous step to determine the matrix parameters and use it to generate the matrix. For instance, the compilers parameters could be replaced from gcc >=4.8 to gcc >=4.8 =6.0 =11 to only test intermediary GCC versions >=6.0 =3.8, which might test your library with too many versions of clang. You could remove intermediary versions of clang with the range clang >=3.8 =10, which ensure old versions are recent versions are covered, while eliminating intermediary versions. Also when a bug is found in a specific version, semver ranges can also help. Consider someone has reported a bug in GCC 8.1, and you want to keep track of that. The semver range gcc >=4.8 =10 would ensure version GCC8.1 specifically, and not any other version is the range >=8.0.0 =11' compilers: 'gcc >=4.8 =9 clang >=3.8 11 msvc >=14 apple-clang * mingw * clang-cl * ' latest-factors: 'gcc Coverage TSan UBSan Fetch-Content clang Fetch-Content ' factors: 'gcc Asan Shared No-Deps msvc Shared x86 clang Time-Trace mingw Shared ' Parameter Description Default compilers A list of compilers to be tested. Each compiler can be complemented with its semver version requirements to be tested. When the compiler version requirements are provided, the action will break the requirements into subsets of major versions to be tested. When no version is provided, the '*' semver requirement is assumed. The action can identifies subsets of compiler versions for GCC, Clang, and MSVC. For any other compilers, the version requirements will passthrough to the output. gcc >=4.8 clang >=3.8 msvc >=14 apple-clang * mingw * clang-cl * standards A semver range describing what C standards should be tested. The compiler ranges are adjusted to only include compilers that support any subrange of these requirements. These requirements can include C standards as 2 or 4 digits versions, such as 11, 2011, 98, or 1998. 2 digit versions are normalized into the 4 digits form so that 11 > 98 (2011 > 1998). >=11 max-standards The maximum number of standards to be tested with each compiler. For instance, if 'max-standards' is 2 and the compiler supports '11,14,17,20,23' given the in the standard requirements, the standards 20,23 will be tested by this compiler. 2 latest-factors The factors to be tested with the latest versions of each compiler. For each factor in this list, the entry with the latest version of a compiler will be duplicated with an entry that sets this factor to true. Other entries will also include this factor as false. The following factors are considered special: 'asan', 'ubsan', 'msan', 'tsan', and 'coverage'. When these factors are defined in an entry, its 'ccflags', 'cxxflags', and 'linkflags' value are also modified to include the suggested flags for factor. gcc Coverage TSan UBSan factors The factors to be tested with other versions of each compiler. Each factor in this list will be injected into a version of the compiler that is not the latest version. An entry with the latest version of the compiler will be duplicated with this factor if there are no entries left to inject the factor. Other entries will also include this factor as false. gcc Asan Shared msvc Shared x86 clang Time-Trace mingw Shared generate-summary Generate summary with the complete matrix. true trace-commands Trace commands executed by the action. false Output Description matrix The test matrix is an array of dictionaries, where each entry represents a combination of compiler version and factors to be tested. Each entry in the test matrix dictionary contains the following key-value pairs: - name: A suggested name for the job testing this entry - runs-on: A suggested github runner image name for the job testing this entry - container: A suggested docker container for the job testing this entry - compiler: Specifies the name of the compiler to be used for the test configuration. This can be used as input to the setup-cpp action. - version: Specifies the version requirements of the compiler to be used for the test configuration. This can be used as input to the setup-cpp action. - major, minor, patch: Specifies the version components of the compiler whenever the whole range includes a single major, minor, or patch. - has_major, has_minor, has_patch: Determines if the corresponding version component of the compiler is available representing all versions in the range. - is-latest: Specifies whether the entry version requirement is the latest version among the test configurations. - is-main: Specifies whether the entry version requirement is the latest version among the test configurations without any factors applied. - is-earliest: Specifies whether the entry version requirement is the earliest version among the test configurations. - cxx: The usual name of the C++ compiler executable. If using the setup-cpp action, its output should be used instead. - cc: The usual name of the C compiler executable. If using the setup-cpp action, its output should be used instead. - cxxstd: A list of standards that should be tested with this compiler version. This option considers the max-standards latest standards supported by each compiler in its subrange of standards. - latest-cxxstd: The last standard listed in cxxstd as a convenience variable - b2-toolset: The usual name of the toolset to be used in a b2 workflow. - generator: A CMake generator recommended to run the CMake workflow. - build-type: A build type recommended to test this entry. This is usually Release, unless some special factor that requires Debug is defined. - ccflags: The recommended C flags to be used by this entry. It reflects the values of special factors, such as sanitizers, coverage, and time-trace. - cxxflags: The recommended C++ flags to be used by this entry. It reflects the values of special factors, such as sanitizers, coverage, and time-trace. - install: The recommended packages to be installed before running the workflow. This includes packages such as build-essential for ubuntu containers and lcov for coverage entries. - …​: Provides additional factors or attributes associated with the test configuration as defined by the factors and latest-factors inputs. These usually include variant build configurations spread among the entries, such as asan, coverage, and shared libraries.","title":"C++ Matrix","component":"cpp-actions","version":"master","name":"cpp-matrix","url":"/cpp-actions/actions/cpp-matrix.html","titles":[{"text":"Motivation","hash":"_motivation","id":1},{"text":"C++ Test Matrix","hash":"_c_test_matrix","id":2},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":3},{"text":"Variable matrices","hash":"_variable_matrices","id":4},{"text":"About matrix recommendations","hash":"_about_matrix_recommendations","id":5},{"text":"Ignoring recommendations","hash":"_ignoring_recommendations","id":6},{"text":"Adjusting semver ranges","hash":"_adjusting_semver_ranges","id":7},{"text":"Overriding recommendations","hash":"_overriding_recommendations","id":8},{"text":"Auxiliary keys","hash":"_auxiliary_keys","id":9},{"text":"Use scripts","hash":"_use_scripts","id":10},{"text":"Next steps","hash":"_next_steps","id":11},{"text":"Example","hash":"_example","id":12},{"text":"Input Parameters","hash":"_input_parameters","id":13},{"text":"Outputs","hash":"_outputs","id":14}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"This action creates an initial Changelog from the commit history.

In most workflows, this is used as an auxiliary action for the setup-cpp action. This allows us to test a C++ library with any GCC version, and not only the versions circumstantially provided by apt-get. This action uses a number of alternatives to find or install GCC: The GCC path provided to 'path' Any other version of GCC it can find in the system Any other version of GCC available from APT A version of GCC from our own binary releases The action will not attempt to install GCC from source files, which is the only officially supported method but impossible to run in CI because the machines would take hours to do that. If a version of GCC is not available by any other methods above, the GCC binaries for a given platform can be built locally with a script provided in this repository and added to our binary release. In most workflows, this is used as an auxiliary action for the Setup C++ action, which already calls this action if necessary. After setting up the proper C++ compiler for a matrix entry, the next step in your workflow should usually be Install Packages. Parameter Description Default version Version range or exact version of GCC to use, using SemVer’s version range syntax. By default, it uses any version available in the environment. * path Path to the gcc or g++ executable. We attempt to find GCC at this path first. check-latest By default, when GCC is not available, this action will install the minimum version in the version spec.
