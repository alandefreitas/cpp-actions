challenging task, as there are various factors to consider such as the different compilers, operating systems, and architectures that the library may need to support. Furthermore, C++ itself is a complex language with a wide range of features, making it difficult to write comprehensive tests that cover all possible scenarios. To address these challenges, this repository provides a collection of GitHub actions that are specifically designed to test C++ libraries in a variety of environments. These actions aim to create a common and resilient set of tools that can be used to test libraries across a wide range of platforms and configurations. By leveraging the power of GitHub Actions, these C++ testing tools can be easily integrated into a development workflow, allowing developers to quickly and efficiently test their libraries with minimal effort. This can help to ensure that the library is functioning correctly and that it is compatible with a wide range of platforms and configurations. Whether you are a seasoned C++ developer or just starting out, these testing tools can help you to streamline your development workflow and ensure that your library is robust and reliable. With a comprehensive set of testing tools at your disposal, you can focus on writing high-quality code and delivering great software to your users.","title":"C++ Actions","component":"cpp-actions","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/cpp-actions/index.html","titles":[]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"Boost Software License - Version 1.0 - August 17th, 2003 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organization obtaining a copy of the software and accompanying documentation covered by this license (the \"Software\") to use, reproduce, display, distribute, execute, and transmit the Software, and to prepare derivative works of the Software, and to permit third-parties to whom the Software is furnished to do so, all subject to the following: The copyright notices in the Software and this entire statement, including the above license grant, this restriction and the following disclaimer, must be included in all copies of the Software, in whole or in part, and all derivative works of the Software, unless such copies or derivative works are solely in the form of machine-executable object code generated by a source language processor.

A workflow is composed of the following steps: Configure Build Test Install The action also sets up the environment for the workflow: It validates the CMake version installed in the system, Updates CMake if the library has a different minimum version, Identifies what features the current CMake version supports, and Runs a complete cmake workflow The action will adjusts the parameters as needed according to the features that CMake version supports. For instance, If the CMake version does not support the -S …​ -B …​ syntax, the action will create the build directory and run the configuration step from there. If the specified or default generator is multi-config, CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES will be used instead of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, since the later is ignored by these generators. If the CMake version does not support the cmake --install syntax, the cmake --build --target install will be use instead. If the CMake version does not support multiple targets in the cmake --build syntax, the action will run the build step once for each target. The action also creates GitHub annotations when warnings or errors are emitted at any of these steps. This includes annotations for CMake errors at the configure step and build errors emitted from the compiler at the build step.

A workflow is composed of the following steps: Configure Build Test Install The action also sets up the environment for the workflow: It validates the CMake version installed in the system, Updates CMake if the library has a different minimum version, Identifies what features the current CMake version supports, and Runs a complete cmake workflow The action will adjusts the parameters as needed according to the features that CMake version supports. For instance, If the CMake version does not support the -S …​ -B …​ syntax, the action will create the build directory and run the configuration step from there. If the specified or default generator is multi-config, CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES will be used instead of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, since the later is ignored by these generators. If the CMake version does not support the cmake --install syntax, the cmake --build --target install will be use instead. If the CMake version does not support multiple targets in the cmake --build syntax, the action will run the build step once for each target. The action also creates GitHub annotations when warnings or errors are emitted at any of these steps. This includes annotations for CMake errors at the configure step and build errors emitted from the compiler at the build step.
