challenging task, as there are various factors to consider such as the different compilers, operating systems, and architectures that the library may need to support. Furthermore, C++ itself is a complex language with a wide range of features, making it difficult to write comprehensive tests that cover all possible scenarios. To address these challenges, this repository provides a collection of GitHub actions that are specifically designed to test C++ libraries in a variety of environments. These actions aim to create a common and resilient set of tools that can be used to test libraries across a wide range of platforms and configurations. By leveraging the power of GitHub Actions, these C++ testing tools can be easily integrated into a development workflow, allowing developers to quickly and efficiently test their libraries with minimal effort. This can help to ensure that the library is functioning correctly and that it is compatible with a wide range of platforms and configurations. Whether you are a seasoned C++ developer or just starting out, these testing tools can help you to streamline your development workflow and ensure that your library is robust and reliable. With a comprehensive set of testing tools at your disposal, you can focus on writing high-quality code and delivering great software to your users.","title":"C++ Actions","component":"cpp-actions","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/cpp-actions/index.html","titles":[]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"Boost Software License - Version 1.0 - August 17th, 2003 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organization obtaining a copy of the software and accompanying documentation covered by this license (the \"Software\") to use, reproduce, display, distribute, execute, and transmit the Software, and to prepare derivative works of the Software, and to permit third-parties to whom the Software is furnished to do so, all subject to the following: The copyright notices in the Software and this entire statement, including the above license grant, this restriction and the following disclaimer, must be included in all copies of the Software, in whole or in part, and all derivative works of the Software, unless such copies or derivative works are solely in the form of machine-executable object code generated by a source language processor.

A library that works flawlessly with one compiler might encounter issues when compiled with a different version or on a different platform. This is where the C Library Test Matrix GitHub Action comes to the rescue. The C Library Test Matrix GitHub Action is designed to automate the generation of a comprehensive test matrix for your C libraries given their requirements. It simplifies the process of testing your libraries across multiple compiler versions and platforms, reducing the manual effort and potential for human error. With this action, you can define a set of compiler versions, target platforms, standard requirements, and factors that you want to test your C++ library against. The action then automatically generates a test matrix by combining the specified compilers and platforms into a fractional factorial design, enabling you to run tests in a systematic and efficient manner. This action can ensure that your C++ library is thoroughly tested across a wide range of compiler versions and platforms. This approach significantly increases the chances of catching compatibility issues early on and helps in delivering a robust and reliable library that works across different environments. Automated test matrix generation: Define a list of compiler versions and platforms, and let the action handle the creation of the test matrix. Easy integration: Simply include the C++ Library Test Matrix GitHub Action in your workflow configuration to start generating the test matrix. Customization options: Fine-tune the test matrix generation process by specifying additional compiler flags, build configurations, or test suites. Comprehensive test coverage: Ensure your C++ library is thoroughly tested across multiple compiler versions and platforms to identify and address compatibility issues. Get started with the C Library Test Matrix GitHub Action today and streamline your C library testing process. Say goodbye to manual matrix creation and embrace automated, systematic testing to deliver high-quality C++ libraries that work seamlessly across different compilers and platforms. The action should be run as extra initial “setup” job in your workflow. The job will run the action and output matrix, which is a JSON string containing the whole matrix. This matrix should be output of your first setup job. In your second build job, you can attribute the entire matrix to the strategy.matrix.include parameter and create your workflow as usual with the parameters from the matrix: jobs: cpp-matrix: runs-on: ubuntu-latest name: Generate Test Matrix outputs: matrix: ${{ steps.cpp-matrix.outputs.matrix }} steps: - name: Generate Test Matrix uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/cpp-matrix@master id: cpp-matrix with: standards: '>=11' build: needs: cpp-matrix strategy: fail-fast: false matrix: include: fromJSON(needs.cpp-matrix.outputs.matrix) # use matrix entries name: ${{ matrix.name }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.runs-on }} container: ${{ matrix.container }} steps: - name: Clone library uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Setup C++ Compiler uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/setup-cpp@master id: setup-cpp with: compiler: ${{ matrix.compiler }} version: ${{ matrix.version }} - name: CMake Workflow uses: ./cmake-workflow with: cc: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cc || matrix.cc }} cxx: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cxx || matrix.cxx }} cxxstd: ${{ matrix.cxxstd }} cxxflags: ${{ matrix.cxxstd }} # And you've safely tested your C++ library just like that... steps: - name: Generate Test Matrix uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/cpp-matrix@master id: cpp-matrix with: standards: '>=11' factors: 'gcc Asan Shared No-Deps msvc Shared x86 clang Time-Trace mingw Shared ' Parameter Description Default compilers A list of compilers to be tested. Each compiler can be complemented with its semver version requirements to be tested. When the compiler version requirements are provided, the action will break the requirements into subsets of major versions to be tested.

For any other compilers, the version requirements will passthrough to the output. . gcc >=4.8 clang >=3.8 msvc >=14.2 apple-clang * mingw * clang-cl * standards A semver range describing what C standards should be tested. The compiler ranges are adjusted to only include compilers that support any subrange of these requirements. These requirements can include C standards as 2 or 4 digits versions, such as 11, 2011, 98, or 1998. 2 digit versions are normalized into the 4 digits form so that 11 > 98 (2011 > 1998). . >=11 max-standards The maximum number of standards to be tested with each compiler.

For each factor in this list, the entry with the latest version of a compiler will be duplicated with an entry that sets this factor to true. Other entries will also include this factor as false. The following factors are considered special: 'asan', 'ubsan', 'msan', 'tsan', and 'coverage'. When these factors are defined in an entry, its 'ccflags', 'cxxflags', and 'linkflags' value are also modified to include the suggested flags for factor. . gcc Coverage TSan UBSan factors The factors to be tested with other versions of each compiler. Each factor in this list will be injected into a version of the compiler that is not the latest version.

By default, it uses any version available in the environment. . * path The gcc or g++ executable. We attempt to find GCC at this path first. g++ cache Used to specify whether the GCC installation should be cached in the case GCC needs to be downloaded.\" . false architecture The target architecture (x86, x64). By default, this value is inferred. . check-latest By default, when GCC is not available, this action will install the minimum version in the version spec. This ensures the code respects its contract in terms of what minimum GCC version is supported. Set this option if you want the action to check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec instead. . false update-environment Set this option if you want the action to update environment variables. true update-ld-library-path Set this option if you want the action to update LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Updating LD_LIBRARY_PATH might cause conflicts with system libraries and is usually unnecessary because the binaries are built on equivalent containers. However, this is necessary on some custom containers and you can set this option to let the action automatically add GCC library paths to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. . false trace-commands Trace commands executed by the workflow. false Output Description cc The absolute path to the gcc executable. cxx The absolute path to the g++ executable. dir The absolute path to the GCC directory containing the executable. version The installed GCC version. Useful when given a version range as input. version-major The installed GCC version major. Useful when given a version range as input. version-minor The installed GCC version minor. Useful when given a version range as input. version-patch The installed GCC version patch. Useful when given a version range as input. cache-hit A boolean value to indicate a cache entry was found","title":"Setup
