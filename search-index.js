challenging task, as there are various factors to consider such as the different compilers, operating systems, and architectures that the library may need to support. Furthermore, C++ itself is a complex language with a wide range of features, making it difficult to write comprehensive tests that cover all possible scenarios. To address these challenges, this repository provides a collection of GitHub actions that are specifically designed to test C++ libraries in a variety of environments. These actions aim to create a common and resilient set of tools that can be used to test libraries across a wide range of platforms and configurations. By leveraging the power of GitHub Actions, these C++ testing tools can be easily integrated into a development workflow, allowing developers to quickly and efficiently test their libraries with minimal effort. This can help to ensure that the library is functioning correctly and that it is compatible with a wide range of platforms and configurations. Whether you are a seasoned C++ developer or just starting out, these testing tools can help you to streamline your development workflow and ensure that your library is robust and reliable. With a comprehensive set of testing tools at your disposal, you can focus on writing high-quality code and delivering great software to your users.","title":"C++ Actions","component":"cpp-actions","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/cpp-actions/index.html","titles":[]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"Boost Software License - Version 1.0 - August 17th, 2003 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organization obtaining a copy of the software and accompanying documentation covered by this license (the \"Software\") to use, reproduce, display, distribute, execute, and transmit the Software, and to prepare derivative works of the Software, and to permit third-parties to whom the Software is furnished to do so, all subject to the following: The copyright notices in the Software and this entire statement, including the above license grant, this restriction and the following disclaimer, must be included in all copies of the Software, in whole or in part, and all derivative works of the Software, unless such copies or derivative works are solely in the form of machine-executable object code generated by a source language processor.

If you are developing a Boost library, this is usually the next step in your workflow after setting up a C++ compiler and fetching dependencies with Install Packages. It takes the Boost source directory and runs the usual steps to test the specified modules. This includes compiling b2 if needed and generating a proper user-config.jam file. This action is particularly useful for Boost library proposals, where B2 is mandatory. It assumes the library being tested is in the libs directory of the Boost super-project and that source-dir is the root of the super-project. If your library also supports CMake, the next step in your workflow should usually be CMake Workflow. Otherwise, the next step in your workflow should usually be the generation of reports, with tools such as the Create Flamegraph (when matrix.time-trace) and Create Changelog (usually in another workflow job). You can also include customs steps to upload coverage reports (when matrix.coverage). If your b2 workflow provides CMake installation and configuration scripts, it is also usual to include multiple CMake workflow steps as integration tests for CMake. steps: - name: B2 Workflow uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/b2-workflow@master with: source-dir: ${{ steps.boost-clone.outputs.boost-dir }} modules: variant2 toolset: ${{ matrix.b2-toolset }} build-variant: ${{ matrix.build-type }} cxx: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cxx || matrix.cxx || '' }} cxxstd: ${{ matrix.cxxstd }} address-model: ${{ (matrix.x86 && '32') || '64' }} asan: ${{ matrix.asan }} ubsan: ${{ matrix.ubsan }} tsan: ${{ matrix.tsan }} shared: ${{ matrix.shared }} Parameter Description Default source-dir The boost source directory. This path will be used to build and install B2 for the workflow and test the specified modules. . build-dir Changes the build directories for all project roots being built. When this option is specified, all Jamroot files must declare a project name. The build directory for the project root will be computed by concatenating the value of the --build-dir option, the project name specified in Jamroot, and the build dir specified in Jamroot (or bin, if none is specified). The option is primarily useful when building from read-only media, when you can’t modify Jamroot. cxx Path to C++ compiler. If the input is not specified, the action will use the compiler defined by the environment variable CXX. If the environment variable is not specified, the action will use the default compiler as identified by B2. cxxflags Flags to be used with the C++ compiler. If the input is not specified, the action will use the flags defined by the environment variable CXXFLAGS. If the environment variable is not specified, the action will use the default flags as identified by B2. ccflags Flags to be used with the C compiler. If the input is not specified, the action will use the flags defined by the environment variable CFLAGS. If the environment variable is not specified, the action will use the default flags as identified by B2. cxxstd Comma-separated list of standards with which B2 will build and test the program. If the input is not specified, the action will use the standards defined by the environment variable CXXSTD. If the environment variable is not specified, the action will use the default standards as identified by B2. B2 will iteratively build and test the specified modules with multiple standards. shared Determines if the link option should be shared so that it creates shared libraries. If the input is not specified, the action will use the value defined by the environment variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS. If the environment variable is not specified, the action will use the default value as identified by B2. toolset B2 toolset name. The toolset is somewhat equivalent to a CMake generator. If not specified, the action will use the toolset defined by the environment variable B2_TOOLSET. If the environment variable is not specified, the action will use the default toolset detected by B2. build-variant Custom build variants. If the provided variant is a CMake build-type, the argument is mapped to the equivalent B2 variant: - Release → release - Debug → debug - RelWithDebInfo → release with debug-symbols=on - → lowercase If the input is not specified, the action will use the value defined by the environment variable B2_BUILD_VARIANT. If the environment variable is not specified, the action will use the value from build-type. build-type An alternative to build-variant, for compatibility with CMake workflows. When build-variant is not provided, this input is used to set the build variant. If the input is not specified, the action will use the value defined by the environment variable B2_BUILD_TYPE. If the environment variable is not specified, the action will use the default value as identified by B2. modules The list of modules we should test with B2 in the libs directory of the Boost super-project. The directory libs//test will be provided for each module in the list. ⚠️ This parameter is required. address-model Valid B2 list of address models. asan Enable address-sanitizer. ubsan Enable undefined-sanitizer. tsan Enable thread-sanitizer. coverage Enable coverage. linkflags Extra linker flags. threading B2 threading option. rtti Enables or disables run-time type information. clean Cleans all targets in the current directory and in any sub-projects. Note that unlike the clean target in make, you can use --clean together with target names to clean specific targets. false clean-all Cleans all targets, no matter where they are defined. In particular, it will clean targets in parent Jamfiles, and targets defined under other project roots. false abbreviate-paths Compresses target paths by abbreviating each component.

Only the specified modules are cloned and cached. This is usually the next step in your workflow after setting up a C++ compiler with Setup C++ or installing other dependencies with Install Packages. Cloning boost is useful when one wants the always use the latest version of boost in a library or is writing a boost proposal. For other use cases, individual boost modules can be fetched with vcpkg in Install Packages or directly included in a package manager manifest. Besides the explicitly specified list of modules, the action can also scan directories for boost dependencies to implicitly determine what modules should be cloned. The union of the implicitly and explicitly specified modules is cloned. Caching is based only on these dependencies. For a project with about 5 boost dependencies, caching saves about 4 minutes in the workflow. When there’s no cache, the scanning scripting saves us about 3 minutes. After cloning boost modules for your C++ project, the next step in your workflow should usually be CMake Workflow.

This is usually the next step in your workflow after setting up a C++ compiler and fetching dependencies with Install Packages. A workflow is composed of the following steps: Configure Build Test Install The action also sets up the environment for the workflow: It validates the CMake version installed in the system, Updates CMake if the library has a different minimum version, Identifies what features the current CMake version supports, and Runs a complete cmake workflow The action will adjusts the parameters as needed according to the features that CMake version supports. For instance, If the CMake version does not support the -S …​ -B …​ syntax, the action will create the build directory and run the configuration step from there. If the specified or default generator is multi-config, CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES will be used instead of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, since the later is ignored by these generators. If the CMake version does not support the cmake --install syntax, the cmake --build --target install will be use instead. If the CMake version does not support multiple targets in the cmake --build syntax, the action will run the build step once for each target. The action also creates GitHub annotations when warnings or errors are emitted at any of these steps. This includes annotations for CMake errors at the configure step and build errors emitted from the compiler at the build step. After running the a complete CMake workflow for your project, the next step in your workflow should usually be the generation of reports, with tools such as the Create Flamegraph (when matrix.time-trace) and Create Changelog (usually in another workflow job). You can also include customs steps to upload coverage reports (when matrix.coverage). If your project provides CMake installation and configuration scripts, it is also usual to include multiple CMake workflow steps as integration tests for CMake. steps: - name: CMake Workflow uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/cmake-workflow@master with: cmake-version: '>=3.20' source-dir: tests generator: ${{ matrix.generator }} generator-toolset: ${{ matrix.generator-toolset }} toolchain: ${{ steps.package-install.outputs.vcpkg-toolchain }} build-type: ${{ matrix.build-type }} run-tests: true install-prefix: .local cxxstd: ${{ matrix.cxxstd }} cc: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cc || matrix.cc }} ccflags: ${{ matrix.ccflags }} cxx: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cxx || matrix.cxx }} cxxflags: ${{ matrix.cxxflags }} shared: ${{ matrix.shared }} extra-args: \"${{ ( !matrix.no-deps && format('-D BOOST_SRC_DIR=\\\"{0}\\\"', steps.boost-clone.outputs.boost-dir)\\ \\ ) || '' }} \\n${{ ( matrix.no-deps && '-D CPP_ACTIONS_NO_DEPS=ON' ) || '' }}\\n\" export-compile-commands: ${{ matrix.time-trace }} package: true package-artifact: ${{ matrix.is-main }} ref-source-dir: .

If the input is not specified, the action will use the value defined by the environment variable CMAKE_RUN_TESTS. If the environment variable is also not specified, the action will attempt to run tests but will not fail if there are no tests. When the value is true or false, the action will also set the configure-tests-flag to ON or OFF. When the value is undefined, the configure-tests-flag is ignored. configure-tests-flag Specify the flag to be passed to cmake to enable/disable tests in the configuration step. By default this is BUILD_TESTING, which is an option automatically created by the CTest module. If the input contains a \"=\", the action will use the value as is.

If the input is not specified, the action will use the value defined by the environment variable CMAKE_CREATE_ANNOTATIONS. If the environment variable is also not specified, the action will create annotations. ref-source-dir A reference base directory for annotations. For instance, if there is an error in the /home/user/project/src/main.cpp file, the action will create an annotation referring to the repository path src/main.cpp. If the reference source directory is /home/user/project/src, the action will create an annotation referring to main.cpp instead because any annotation filename will be relative to this directory. If no value is provided, the environment variable GITHUB_WORKSPACE will be used as the reference source directory. This means all annotations will be relative to the repository root if actions/checkout has been called without specifying a custom path option. Changing this value is typically useful when the repository being tested is not the workspace directory, in which we need to make annotations relative to some other directory. In most cases, the default option should be enough. trace-commands Trace commands executed by the workflow. false","title":"CMake Workflow","component":"cpp-actions","version":"master","name":"cmake-workflow","url":"/cpp-actions/actions/cmake-workflow.html","titles":[{"text":"Next steps","hash":"_next_steps","id":1},{"text":"Example","hash":"_example","id":2},{"text":"Input Parameters","hash":"_input_parameters","id":3}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"Testing C++ libraries can be a challenging and time-consuming task, especially when considering the various compiler versions, error behaviors, and platform dependencies. A library that works flawlessly with one compiler will almost certainly fail to build with a different compiler version, not mention different compilers and platforms. This has a viral effect with enormous implications to the C++ ecosystem. If your library doesn’t properly test and support all platforms in its manifest, this support is also broken for any projects depending on your library. With some notable exceptions, this is currently the case with most small standalone libraries one can find on GitHub. These are libraries that could be very useful otherwise, so avoid dependencies altogether is not a reasonable to the problem, since we will never get anywhere meaningful if we’re not able to stand to the shoulder of giants. The C Matrix Action is designed to automate the generation of a comprehensive test matrix for your C libraries given their requirements. It simplifies the process of defining the contract of what platforms your library supports and testing your project across a proper selected subset of revelant compiler versions and platforms. With this action, you can define a set of requirements to test your C++ library. It will then generate a test matrix by combining the specified requirements into a fractional factorial design to ensure all proper combinations are tested in a systematic manner. This approach significantly increases the chances of catching compatibility issues early on and helps in delivering a robust and reliable library to users. The action should be run as extra initial “setup” job in your workflow. The job will run the action and output matrix, which is a JSON string containing the whole matrix. This matrix should be output of your first setup job. In your second build job, you can attribute the entire matrix to the strategy.matrix.include parameter and create your workflow as usual with the parameters from the matrix: jobs: cpp-matrix: runs-on: ubuntu-latest name: Generate Test Matrix outputs: matrix: ${{ steps.cpp-matrix.outputs.matrix }} steps: - name: Generate Test Matrix uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/cpp-matrix@master id: cpp-matrix with: standards: '>=11' build: needs: cpp-matrix strategy: fail-fast: false matrix: include: fromJSON(needs.cpp-matrix.outputs.matrix) # use matrix entries name: ${{ matrix.name }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.runs-on }} container: ${{ matrix.container }} steps: - name: Clone library uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Setup C++ Compiler uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/setup-cpp@master id: setup-cpp with: compiler: ${{ matrix.compiler }} version: ${{ matrix.version }} - name: CMake Workflow uses: ./cmake-workflow with: cc: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cc || matrix.cc }} cxx: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cxx || matrix.cxx }} cxxstd: ${{ matrix.cxxstd }} cxxflags: ${{ matrix.cxxstd }} # And you've safely tested your C++ library just like that... In some cases, it might be useful to test different matrices based on the conditions of the workflow. These conditions might be the event_type and the types of files changed in the commit triggering the workflow. The workflows might vary between disabling tests for changes that don’t affect these certain files, running a reduced subset of tests for less important changes, or enabling extra tests, such as documentation tests in case only these files have been changed. This might be useful in terms of performance, costs, and safety. While this is hard to achieve with hard-coded matrices, this action makes variable matrices very easy to achieve. Simply define a previous step to determine the matrix parameters and use it to generate the matrix. For instance, the compilers parameters could be replaced from gcc >=4.8 to gcc >=4.8 =6.0 =11 to only test intermediary GCC versions >=6.0 =3.8, which might test your library with too many versions of clang. You could remove intermediary versions of clang with the range clang >=3.8 =10, which ensure old versions are recent versions are covered, while eliminating intermediary versions. Also when a bug is found in a specific version, semver ranges can also help. Consider someone has reported a bug in GCC 8.1, and you want to keep track of that. The semver range gcc >=4.8 =10 would ensure version GCC8.1 specifically, and not any other version is the range >=8.0.0 =11' compilers: 'gcc >=4.8 =9 clang >=3.8 11 msvc >=14 apple-clang * mingw * clang-cl * ' latest-factors: 'gcc Coverage TSan UBSan Fetch-Content clang Fetch-Content ' factors: 'gcc Asan Shared No-Deps msvc Shared x86 clang Time-Trace mingw Shared ' Parameter Description Default compilers A list of compilers to be tested. Each compiler can be complemented with its semver version requirements to be tested. When the compiler version requirements are provided, the action will break the requirements into subsets of major versions to be tested. When no version is provided, the '*' semver requirement is assumed. The action can identifies subsets of compiler versions for GCC, Clang, and MSVC. For any other compilers, the version requirements will passthrough to the output. gcc >=4.8 clang >=3.8 msvc >=14 apple-clang * mingw * clang-cl * standards A semver range describing what C standards should be tested. The compiler ranges are adjusted to only include compilers that support any subrange of these requirements. These requirements can include C standards as 2 or 4 digits versions, such as 11, 2011, 98, or 1998. 2 digit versions are normalized into the 4 digits form so that 11 > 98 (2011 > 1998). >=11 max-standards The maximum number of standards to be tested with each compiler. For instance, if 'max-standards' is 2 and the compiler supports '11,14,17,20,23' given the in the standard requirements, the standards 20,23 will be tested by this compiler. 2 latest-factors The factors to be tested with the latest versions of each compiler. For each factor in this list, the entry with the latest version of a compiler will be duplicated with an entry that sets this factor to true. Other entries will also include this factor as false. The following factors are considered special: 'asan', 'ubsan', 'msan', 'tsan', and 'coverage'. When these factors are defined in an entry, its 'ccflags', 'cxxflags', and 'linkflags' value are also modified to include the suggested flags for factor. gcc Coverage TSan UBSan factors The factors to be tested with other versions of each compiler. Each factor in this list will be injected into a version of the compiler that is not the latest version. An entry with the latest version of the compiler will be duplicated with this factor if there are no entries left to inject the factor. Other entries will also include this factor as false. gcc Asan Shared msvc Shared x86 clang Time-Trace mingw Shared sanitizer-build-type Determine the default build type to suggest when testing with sanitizers.

If using the setup-cpp action, its output should be used instead. - cc: The usual name of the C compiler executable. If using the setup-cpp action, its output should be used instead. - cxxstd: A list of standards that should be tested with this compiler version. This option considers the max-standards latest standards supported by each compiler in its subrange of standards. - latest-cxxstd: The last standard listed in cxxstd as a convenience variable - b2-toolset: The usual name of the toolset to be used in a b2 workflow. - generator: A CMake generator recommended to run the CMake workflow. - build-type: A build type recommended to test this entry. This is usually Release, unless some special factor that requires Debug is defined. - ccflags: The recommended C flags to be used by this entry.

Alternatively, if your libraries depends on Boost, the next step in your workflow should usually be Boost Clone, which allows the workflow to only download the required subset of Boost libraries required by the project. steps: - name: Install packages uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/package-install@master id: package-install with: vcpkg: ${{ (!matrix.fetch-content && 'fmt') || '' }} vcpkg-triplet: ${{ matrix.triplet }} apt-get: ${{ matrix.install }} ${{ matrix.container && 'pkg-config' }} apt-get-ignore-missing: ${{ matrix.container && 'true' }} cc: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cc || matrix.cc }} ccflags: ${{ matrix.ccflags }} cxx: ${{ steps.setup-cpp.outputs.cxx || matrix.cxx }} cxxflags: ${{ matrix.cxxflags }} Parameter Description Default vcpkg List of packages we should install with vcpkg. (Whitespace-separated). apt-get List of packages we should install with apt-get. (Whitespace-separated). cxx C compiler used by vcpkg. Setting the compiler is particularly important in Linux workflows that use `clang`, since `clang` might link `libc` or libstdc`, while the default compiler used by vcpkg will usually be GCC linking `libstdc.
