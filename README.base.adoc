= C++ Actions

This repository includes a number of useful GitHub actions to test C++ libraries.
Part of the difficulty to test C++ libraries comes from the diversity of the C++ ecosystem.
Our intention is to create a common and resilient set of actions that can work on as many environments as possible.
