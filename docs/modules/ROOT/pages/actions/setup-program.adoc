// This setup-program.adoc file is automatically generated.
// Edit parse_actions.py instead.

Set up a specific version of a program and add it to the PATH.
This action is inspired in the cmake command find_program and the setup-python action.

This allows us to find a certain version of program in the host environment and, if it
cannot be found, fallback to basic patterns to download and install it.

This action uses a number of alternatives to find or install a program:

- The program path hints provided to 'path'
- Any other version of the program it can find in the system
- Any other version of the program available from APT
- A version of the program from a link to binary releases

In most workflows, this is used in conjunction to the xref:actions/setup-cpp.adoc[] and
xref:actions/package-install.adoc[] actions to find or install extra programs necessary
for the workflow that are not easily available from package managers or could already be
available in the environment.

== Next steps

After setting up the dependencies for your C++ project, the next step in your workflow should usually be
xref:actions/cmake-workflow.adoc[].

== Input Parameters

|===
|Parameter |Description |Default
|`name` |The name of the executable we should look for.

This parameter can also include a list of names to look for. ⚠️ This parameter is required. |
|`version` |Version range or exact version of the program to use, using SemVer's version range syntax.

By default, it uses any version available in the environment.

If a version is provided, any executable found will be run with the --version option
and the result will be parsed to look for a semver version, which will be considered
the version we found. |`*`
|`path` |Specify directories and paths to search in addition to the default locations.

The paths can be separated by ':' or ';'. |
|`check-latest` |Set this option if you want the action to check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec. |`false`
|`url` |The URL to download the program binaries when it is not available in the environment.

To simplify the download, the URL can contain the following placeholders:

- `{\{name}}`: The program name.

- `{\{version}}`: The version of the program to download. (coerced from the version input)

- `{\{version-major}}`: The major version of the program to download. (coerced from the version input)

- `{\{version-minor}}`: The minor version of the program to download. (coerced from the version input)

- `{\{version-patch}}`: The patch version of the program to download. (coerced from the version input)

- `{\{platform}}`: The platform name. (process.platform)

- `{\{os}}`: The operating system name. (process.platform converted to 'windows', 'macos', or 'linux')

- `{\{arch}}`: The architecture name. (process.arch). |
|`install-prefix` |The directory where the tool should be installed if it's not available in the environment.

By default, the tool will be installed in the hosttools cache directory. |
|`update-environment` |Set this option if you want the action to update environment variables. |`true`
|`trace-commands` |Trace commands executed by the workflow. |`false`
|`fail-on-error` |Fail if the program is not found. |`true`
|===

== Outputs

|===
|Output |Description
|`path` |The absolute path to the program executable.
|`dir` |The absolute path to the directory containing the executable.
|`version` |The installed program version. Useful when given a version range as input.
|`version-major` |The installed program version major. Useful when given a version range as input.
|`version-minor` |The installed program version minor. Useful when given a version range as input.
|`version-patch` |The installed program version patch. Useful when given a version range as input.
|`found` |Whether the program was found.
