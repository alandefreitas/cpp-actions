// This b2-workflow.adoc file is automatically generated.
// Edit parse_actions.py instead.

This action runs a complete B2 workflow from Boost source files.

If you are developing a boost library, this is usually the next step in your workflow after setting up a C++ compiler
and fetching dependencies with xref:actions/package-install.adoc[].

It takes the Boost source directory and does whatever it needs to test the specified modules. This includes 
compiling `b2` if needed and generating a proper `user-config.jam` file.

This action is particularly useful for Boost library proposals.

== Next steps

If you're library also supports CMake, the next step in your workflow should usually be 
xref:actions/cmake-workflow.adoc[]. Otherwise, the next step in your workflow should usually be
the generation of reports, with tools such as the xref:actions/flamegraph.adoc[] (when `matrix.time-trace`) and 
xref:actions/create-changelog.adoc[] (usually in another workflow job). You can also include customs steps to
upload coverage reports (when `matrix.coverage`).

If your b2 workflow provides CMake installation and configuration scripts, it is also usual to include multiple
CMake workflow steps as integration tests for CMake.

argument is mapped to the equivalent b2 variant:

- `Release` -> `release`

- `Debug` -> `debug`

- `RelWithDebInfo` -> `profile`

- `<other>` -> lowercase <other>. |
|`modules` |The list of modules we should test. ⚠️ This parameter is required. |
|`toolset` |Toolset name. |
|`address-model` |Valid b2 list of address models. |
|`cxx` |Path to C++ compiler. |
|`cxxflags` |Extra C++ compiler flags. |
|`ccflags` |Extra C compiler flags. |
|`shared` |Build shared libraries. |
|`asan` |Enable address-sanitizer. |
|`ubsan` |Enable undefined-sanitizer. |
|`tsan` |Enable thread-sanitizer. |
|`coverage` |Enable coverage. |
|`linkflags` |Extra linker flags. |
|`cxxstd` |List of standards with which b2 will build and test the program. |
|`threading` |b2 threading option. |
|`rtti` |Enables or disables run-time type information. |
|`trace-commands` |Trace commands executed by the workflow. |`false`
