Testing C++ libraries can be a challenging and time-consuming task, especially when considering the
various compiler versions, error behaviors, and platform dependencies. A library that works flawlessly 
with one compiler might encounter issues when compiled with a different version or on a different
platform. This is where the C++ Library Test Matrix GitHub Action comes to the rescue.

The C++ Library Test Matrix GitHub Action is designed to automate the generation of a comprehensive 
test matrix for your C++ libraries given their requirements. It simplifies the process of testing your
libraries across multiple compiler versions and platforms, reducing the manual effort and potential 
for human error.

With this action, you can define a set of compiler versions, target platforms, standard requirements,
and factors that you want to test your C++ library against. The action then automatically generates 
a test matrix by combining the specified compilers and platforms into a fractional factorial design, 
enabling you to run tests in a systematic and efficient manner.

This action can ensure that your C++ library is thoroughly tested across a wide range of compiler
versions and platforms. This approach significantly increases the chances of catching compatibility 
issues early on and helps in delivering a robust and reliable library that works across different
environments.

- Automated test matrix generation: Define a list of compiler versions and platforms, and let the action handle 
  the creation of the test matrix.
- Easy integration: Simply include the C++ Library Test Matrix GitHub Action in your workflow configuration to 
  start generating the test matrix.
- Customization options: Fine-tune the test matrix generation process by specifying additional compiler flags, 
  build configurations, or test suites.
- Comprehensive test coverage: Ensure your C++ library is thoroughly tested across multiple compiler versions 
  and platforms to identify and address compatibility issues.

Get started with the C++ Library Test Matrix GitHub Action today and streamline your C++ library testing 
process. Say goodbye to manual matrix creation and embrace automated, systematic testing to deliver 
high-quality C++ libraries that work seamlessly across different compilers and platforms.

== Usage

The action should be run as extra initial "`setup`" job in your workflow. The job will run the action and 
output `matrix`, which is a JSON string containing the whole matrix. This matrix should be output of your 
first `setup` job.

In your second `build` job, you can attribute the entire matrix to the `strategy.matrix.include` parameter
and create your workflow as usual with the parameters from the matrix:

== Input Parameters

|===
|Parameter |Description |Default
|`compilers` |A list of compilers to be tested. Each compiler can be complemented with its semver version requirements
to be tested. 

When the compiler version requirements are provided, the action will break the requirements into 
subsets of major versions to be tested. When no version is provided, the '*' semver requirement
is assumed. The action can identifies subsets of compiler versions for GCC, Clang, and MSVC.
For any other compilers, the version requirements will passthrough to the output.
. |`gcc >=4.8`

`clang >=3.8`

`msvc >=14.2`

`apple-clang *`

`mingw *`

`clang-cl *`
|`standards` |A semver range describing what C++ standards should be tested.

The compiler ranges are adjusted to only include compilers that support any subrange of these requirements.

These requirements can include C++ standards as 2 or 4 digits versions, such as 11, 2011, 98, or 1998.
2 digit versions are normalized into the 4 digits form so that 11 > 98 (2011 > 1998).
. |`>=11`
|`max-standards` |The maximum number of standards to be tested with each compiler.

For instance, if 'max-standards' is 2 and the compiler supports '11,14,17,20,23' given the in the standard
requirements, the standards 20,23 will be tested by this compiler. 
. |`2`
|`latest-factors` |The factors to be tested with the latest versions of each compiler. For each factor in this list, the
entry with the latest version of a compiler will be duplicated with an entry that sets this factor to true.

Other entries will also include this factor as false.

The following factors are considered special: 'asan', 'ubsan', 'msan', 'tsan', and 'coverage'.
When these factors are defined in an entry, its 'ccflags', 'cxxflags', and 'linkflags' value are
also modified to include the suggested flags for factor.
. |`gcc Coverage TSan UBSan`
|`factors` |The factors to be tested with other versions of each compiler. Each factor in this list will be injected
into a version of the compiler that is not the latest version. An entry with the latest version of the compiler
will be duplicated with this factor if there are no entries left to inject the factor.

Other entries will also include this factor as false.
. |`gcc Asan Shared`

`msvc Shared x86`

`clang Time-Trace`

`mingw Shared`
|`generate-summary` |Generate summary with the complete matrix. |`true`
|`trace-commands` |Trace commands executed by the action. |`false`

== Outputs

|===
|Output |Description
|`matrix` |The test matrix is an array of dictionaries, where each entry represents a combination of compiler version
and factors to be tested. 

Each entry in the test matrix dictionary contains the following key-value pairs:

- `name`: A suggested name for the job testing this entry

- `runs-on`: A suggested github runner image name for the job testing this entry

- `container`: A suggested docker container for the job testing this entry

- `compiler`: Specifies the name of the compiler to be used for the test configuration. This can be used as
  input to the setup-cpp action.

- `version`: Specifies the version requirements of the compiler to be used for the test configuration. This can
  be used as input to the setup-cpp action.

- `is-latest`: Specifies whether the entry version requirement is the latest version among the test configurations.

- `is-main`: Specifies whether the entry version requirement is the latest version among the test configurations
  without any factors applied.

- `is-earliest`: Specifies whether the entry version requirement is the earliest version among the test configurations.

- `cxx`: The usual name of the C++ compiler executable. If using the `setup-cpp` action, its output should be used 
  instead. 

- `cc`: The usual name of the C compiler executable. If using the `setup-cpp` action, its output should be used 
  instead. 

- `cxxstd`: A list of standards that should be tested with this compiler version. This option considers
  the `max-standards` latest standards supported by each compiler in its subrange of `standards`.

- `b2-toolset`: The usual name of the toolset to be used in a b2 workflow.

- `generator`: A CMake generator recommended to run the CMake workflow.

- `build-type`: A build type recommended to test this entry. This is usually `Release`, unless some special 
  factor that requires `Debug` is defined.

- `ccflags`: The recommended C flags to be used by this entry. It reflects the values of special factors, such
   as sanitizers, coverage, and time-trace.

- `cxxflags`: The recommended C++ flags to be used by this entry. It reflects the values of special factors, such
   as sanitizers, coverage, and time-trace.

- `<factors>...`: Provides additional factors or attributes associated with the test configuration as defined by
  the factors and latest-factors inputs. These usually include variant build configurations spread among the
  entries, such as asan, coverage, and shared libraries.
