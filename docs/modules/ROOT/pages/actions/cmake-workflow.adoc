:navtitle: CMake Workflow Action
// This cmake-workflow.adoc file is automatically generated.
// Edit parse_actions.py instead.

This action runs a complete CMake workflow from source files. A workflow is composed of the following steps:

- Configure
- Build
- Test
- Install

The action also sets up the environment for the workflow: 

- It validates the CMake version installed in the system, 
- Updates CMake if the library has a different minimum version, 
- Identifies what features the current CMake version supports, and 
- Runs a complete cmake workflow

The action will adjusts the parameters as needed according to the features that CMake version supports. 
For instance, 

- If the CMake version does not support the `-S ... -B ...` syntax, the action will create the build directory and
run the configuration step from there.
- If the specified or default generator is multi-config, `CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES` will be used instead of 
`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`, since the later is ignored by these generators.
- If the CMake version does not support the `cmake --install` syntax, the `cmake --build --target install`
will be use instead.
- If the CMake version does not support multiple targets in the `cmake --build` syntax, the action will run the build
step once for each target.

The action also creates GitHub annotations when warnings or errors are emitted at any of these steps. This includes
annotations for CMake errors at the configure step and build errors emitted from the compiler at the build step.

== Input Parameters

|===
|Parameter |Description |Default
|`cmake-path` |The cmake executable. |`cmake`
|`cmake-version` |A semver range string with the cmake versions supported by this workflow. 

If the existing version in the environment does not satisfy this requirement, the action install
the min CMake version that satisfies it.

This should usually match the `cmake_minimum_required` defined in your CMakeLists.txt file.
. |
|`source-dir` |Directory for the source files. |`.`
|`build-dir` |Directory for the binaries relative to the source directory. |`build`
|`cc` |Path to C compiler. |
|`ccflags` |Flags to be used with the C compiler. |
|`cxx` |Path to C++ compiler. |
|`cxxstd` |List of standards with which cmake will build and test the program. |
|`cxxflags` |Flags to be used with the C++ compiler. |
|`shared` |Determines if add_library should create shared libraries (`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`). |`false`
|`toolchain` |Path to toolchain. |
|`generator` |Generator name. |
|`build-type` |Build type. |`Release`
|`build-target` |Targets to build instead of the default target. |
|`install-prefix` |Path where the library should be installed. |`.local/usr`
|`extra-args` |Extra arguments to cmake configure command. |
|`run-tests` |Whether we should run tests. |`true`
|`install` |Whether we should install the library. 

The library is only installed once in the `install-prefix`.

The latest std version described in `cxxstd` is used for the installed version.
. |`true`
|`create-annotations` |Create github annotations on errors. |`true`
|`ref-source-dir` |A reference source directory for annotations. Any annotation filename will be relative to this directory.

This is typically useful when the repository being tested is not the current directory, in which
we need to make annotations relative to some other directory.

In most cases, the default option should be enough.
. |`.`
|`trace-commands` |Trace commands executed by the workflow. |`false`
