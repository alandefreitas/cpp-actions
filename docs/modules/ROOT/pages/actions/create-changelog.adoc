= Create Changelog [[create-changelog]]
:reftext: Create Changelog
:navtitle: Create Changelog Action
// This create-changelog.adoc file is automatically generated.
// Edit parse_actions.py instead.

This action creates an initial Changelog from the commit history.

The commits considered go from the latest commit up to a commit containing a version
commit pattern specified by version-pattern.

The result can be used as the initial body for an automated release, a CHANGELOG.md file, or a job summary.

Each commit is parsed as a loose variant of a https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[conventional commit]
in the following format:

[source,none]
----
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
----

* The body and footer are always ignored.
* If no type is indicated, the description goes to an initial "other" category in the message.
* If no scope is indicated, the description goes to an initial "general" scope in the type messages.
* Breaking changes are indicated.

This action uses the local commit history to generate the notes. Ensure the `fetch-depth` option
is set when cloning your repository in CI. If this option is unset, the checkout action will
perform a shallow clone and the Changelog will only include the latest commit.

[source,yml]
----
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
  with:
    fetch-depth: 100
----

This parameter can also be used as a limit on the number of commits the action should consider.

  with:
    output-path: CHANGELOG.md
