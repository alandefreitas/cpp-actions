:navtitle: Setup C++ Action
// This setup-cpp.adoc file is automatically generated.
// Edit parse_actions.py instead.

Set up a C++ compiler and add it to the PATH.

This action routes to the appropriate setup-gcc or setup-clang actions.

Other compilers are passed through. 


== Example

[source,yml]
----
steps:
- name: Setup C++ Compiler
  uses: alandefreitas/cpp-actions/setup-cpp@master
  if: ${{ 'true' && !matrix.install }}
  id: setup-cpp
  with:
    compiler: g++-13

== Input Parameters

|===
|Parameter |Description |Default
|`compiler` |Compiler name. If the compiler contains a version, it overrides 'version'.
. |`*`
|`version` |Version range or exact version of GCC to use, using SemVer's version range syntax. 

By default, it uses any version available in the environment.
. |`*`
|`path` |The compiler executable. We attempt to find the compiler at this path first. |`g++`
|`cache` |Used to specify whether the compiler installation should be cached in case it needs to be downloaded."
. |`true`
|`architecture` |The target architecture (x86, x64). By default, this value is inferred.
. |
|`check-latest` |By default, when the compiler is not available, this action will install the minimum version in the version spec.
This ensures the code respects its contract in terms of what minimum GCC version is supported.

Set this option if you want the action to check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec
instead.
. |`false`
|`update-environment` |Set this option if you want the action to update environment variables. |`true`
|`trace-commands` |Trace commands executed by the workflow. |`true`
|===

== Outputs

|===
|Output |Description
|`cc` |The absolute path to the C compiler executable.
|`cxx` |The absolute path to the C++ compiler executable.
|`dir` |The absolute path to the directory containing the executable.
|`version` |The installed compiler version. Useful when given a version range as input.
|`version-major` |The installed compiler version major. Useful when given a version range as input.
|`version-minor` |The installed compiler version minor. Useful when given a version range as input.
|`version-patch` |The installed compiler version patch. Useful when given a version range as input.
|`cache-hit` |A boolean value to indicate a cache entry was found
