:navtitle: Install Packages Action
// This package-install.adoc file is automatically generated.
// Edit parse_actions.py instead.

This action installs dependencies from multiple package managers for a workflow.

This is usually the next step in your workflow after setting up a C++ compiler with 
xref:actions/setup-cpp.adoc[].

If vcpkg dependencies are required and vcpkg is not available, it will be installed.
Both vcpkg and its dependencies are cached.

When your library depends on vcpkg for dependencies, it's important to run the xref:actions/setup-cpp.adoc[]
before this step because vcpkg packages are built from source and this allows us to use the compiler
set up in the previous step.

== Next steps

After setting up the dependencies for your C++ project, the next step in your workflow should usually be
xref:actions/cmake-workflow.adoc[].

Alternatively, if your libraries depends on Boost, the next step in your workflow should usually be
xref:actions/boost-clone.adoc[], which allows the workflow to only download the required subset of Boost libraries
required by the project.

== Input Parameters

|===
|Parameter |Description |Default
|`vcpkg` |List of packages we should install with vcpkg. (Whitespace-separated). |
|`apt-get` |List of packages we should install with apt-get. (Whitespace-separated). |
|`cxx` |C++ compiler used by vcpkg.

Setting the compiler is particularly important in Linux workflows that use `clang`, since `clang` might link 
`libc++` or `libstdc++`, while the default compiler used by vcpkg will usually be GCC linking `libstdc++`.

This would cause conflict in workflows that later attempt to use vcpkg dependencies.
. |
|`cxxflags` |C++ flags used by vcpkg.
. |
|`cc` |C compiler used by vcpkg. |
|`ccflags` |C flags used by vcpkg.
. |
|`vcpkg-triplet` |The triplet used by vcpkg to install packages. |
|`vcpkg-dir` |The directory where vcpkg should be cloned and installed.

If the directory is unspecified, the runner tool cache is used.
. |
|`vcpkg-branch` |vcpkg branch we should use. |`master`
|`apt-get-retries` |Number of times we should retry when apt-get fails. |`1`
|`apt-get-sources` |List of sources for apt-get. |
|`apt-get-source-keys` |List of source keys for apt-get. |
|`apt-get-ignore-missing` |Whether apt-get should ignore missing packages. |`false`
|`trace-commands` |Trace commands executed by the action. |`false`

== Outputs

|Output |Description
|`vcpkg-toolchain` |vcpkg toolchain file
|`vcpkg-executable` |vcpkg toolchain file
