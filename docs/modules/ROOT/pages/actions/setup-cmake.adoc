:navtitle: Setup CMake Action
// This setup-cmake.adoc file is automatically generated.
// Edit parse_actions.py instead.

Set up a specific version of a CMake compiler and add it to the PATH.

This action will also set-up any dependencies required by CMake.

In most workflows, this is used as an auxiliary action for the xref:actions/cmake-workflow.adoc[] action,
which already calls this action if necessary.


== Input Parameters

|===
|Parameter |Description |Default
|`version` |Version range or exact version of CMake to use, using SemVer's version range syntax. 

Reads from `cmake-file` input if unset.

By default, it uses any version available in the environment.
. |`*`
|`cmake-file` |File containing the CMake version to use in a cmake_minimum_required command. 

Example: A CMakeLists.txt file containing a call to cmake_minimum_required."
. |`CMakeLists.txt`
|`cmake-path` |The cmake executable. We attempt to find cmake at this path first. |`cmake`
|`cache` |Used to specify whether the CMake installation should be cached in the case CMake needs to be downloaded."
. |`True`
|`architecture` |The target architecture (x86, x64). By default, this value is inferred.
. |
|`check-latest` |By default, when CMake is not available, this action will install the minimum version in the version spec.
This ensures the code respects its contract in terms of what minimum CMake version is supported.

Set this option if you want the action to check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec
instead.
. |
|`update-environment` |Set this option if you want the action to update environment variables. |`True`
|`trace-commands` |Trace commands executed by the workflow. |`false`
