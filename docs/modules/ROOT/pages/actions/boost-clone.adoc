:navtitle: Boost Clone Action
// This boost-clone.adoc file is automatically generated.
// Edit parse_actions.py instead.

This action clones the Boost source directory, attempting to get it from the cache first. Only the specified
modules are cloned and cached.

Cloning boost is useful when one wants the always use the latest version of boost in a library or is writing
a boost proposal. For other use cases, individual boost modules can be fetched with vcpkg in 
xref:actions/package-install.adoc[] or directly included in a package manager manifest.

Besides the explicitly specified list of modules, the action can also scan directories for boost dependencies
to implicitly determine what modules should be cloned. 

The union of the implicitly and explicitly specified modules is cloned. Caching is based only on these dependencies.

For a project with about 5 boost dependencies, caching saves about 4 minutes in the workflow. When there's no
cache, the scanning scripting saves us about 3 minutes.
