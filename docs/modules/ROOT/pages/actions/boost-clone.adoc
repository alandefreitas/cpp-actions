:navtitle: Boost Clone Action
// This boost-clone.adoc file is automatically generated.
// Edit parse_actions.py instead.

This action clones the Boost source directory, attempting to get it from the cache first. Only the specified
modules are cloned and cached.

This is usually the next step in your workflow after setting up a C++ compiler with 
xref:actions/setup-cpp.adoc[] or installing other dependencies with xref:actions/package-install.adoc[]. 

Cloning boost is useful when one wants the always use the latest version of boost in a library or is writing
a boost proposal. For other use cases, individual boost modules can be fetched with vcpkg in 
xref:actions/package-install.adoc[] or directly included in a package manager manifest.

Besides the explicitly specified list of modules, the action can also scan directories for boost dependencies
to implicitly determine what modules should be cloned. 

The union of the implicitly and explicitly specified modules is cloned. Caching is based only on these dependencies.

For a project with about 5 boost dependencies, caching saves about 4 minutes in the workflow. When there's no
cache, the scanning scripting saves us about 3 minutes.

== Next steps

After cloning boost modules for your C++ project, the next step in your workflow should usually be
xref:actions/cmake-workflow.adoc[]. If you are developing a Boost library, it is also usual for the next
step to be the xref:actions/b2-workflow.adoc[].


== Example

== Input Parameters

|===
|Parameter |Description |Default
|`boost-dir` |The boost directory. The default value assumes boost is in-source. |
|`branch` |Branch of the super-project. |`master`
|`patches` |Libraries used to patch the boost installation. ⚠️ This parameter is required. |
|`modules` |The boost submodules we need to clone. |
|`modules-scan-paths` |Additional modules subdirectory to scan; can be repeated. |
|`modules-exclude-paths` |Additional modules subdirectory to scan; can be repeated. |`test`
|`scan-modules-dir` |An independent directory we should scan for boost dependencies to clone. |
|`scan-modules-ignore` |List of modules that should be ignored in scan-modules. |
|`trace-commands` |Trace commands executed by the workflow. |`false`

== Outputs

|===
|Output |Description
|`boost-dir` |The absolute path to the boost source files.
