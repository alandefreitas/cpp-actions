Testing {cpp} libraries can be a challenging task, as there are various factors to consider such as the different compilers, operating systems, and architectures that the library may need to support.
Furthermore, {cpp} itself is a complex language with a wide range of features, making it difficult to write comprehensive tests that cover all possible scenarios.

To address these challenges, this repository provides a collection of GitHub actions that are specifically designed to test {cpp} libraries in a variety of environments.
These actions aim to create a common and resilient set of tools that can be used to test libraries across a wide range of platforms and configurations.

By leveraging the power of GitHub Actions, these {cpp} testing tools can be easily integrated into a development workflow, allowing developers to quickly and efficiently test their libraries with minimal effort.
This can help to ensure that the library is functioning correctly and that it is compatible with a wide range of platforms and configurations.

Whether you are a seasoned {cpp} developer or just starting out, these testing tools can help you to streamline your development workflow and ensure that your library is robust and reliable.
With a comprehensive set of testing tools at your disposal, you can focus on writing high-quality code and delivering great software to your users.
